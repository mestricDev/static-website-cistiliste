## Tina CMS Integration

This project includes Tina CMS integration for content management. The content is stored as JSON files within the GitHub repository.

### Configuration

The Tina CMS configuration is located in the `tina/config.js` file. It includes basic settings and defines roles for "editor" and "admin".

### Content Editing

The content editing interface is accessible via the Tina CMS sidebar. You can add and update JSON-based content through this interface. The sample configuration demonstrates how these roles might work.

### Managing Content Updates

Content updates are managed via Git commits. When you make changes through the Tina CMS interface, the changes are committed to the repository.

## Further Extending or Modifying the Project

To extend or modify the project, follow the clear documentation within the code and in this README file. The project structure is organized logically, with separate directories for assets, components, CMS configuration, etc.

Feel free to customize the design, add new pages, or integrate additional features as needed.
